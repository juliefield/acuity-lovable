QUICK FAQ:


1. 
For Internet Explorer, you NEED to run the file online or on local server like xampp!

If you press F12 in IE, and open console (reload the file) you will see these errors:

CSS3117: @font-face failed cross-origin request. Resource access is restricted. 
x-7NZTw0n-ypOAaIE8uSrvesZW2xOQ-xsNqO47m55DA.woff

This means the font is failing offline.






2. 
If the file doesnt work, open/install firebug:

http://getfirebug.com/

Its a MUST have extension for firefox which allows you to see possible erorrs in case (any much more).

Once you have firebug, open CONSOLE and run the file again online or on local server like xampp to see if any errors occur.
