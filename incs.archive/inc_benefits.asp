			<h1>If You Sell Information, Nobody Needs You Anymore.</h1>
			<p>The information age has come and gone.  For a hundred years. products were king.  Then we figured out how to
			store and share information, which ushered in the service industries, which have now come and gone.
			Information-based commerce is dead because:

				<li>
					In 2008, there is nothing that can't be learned in about 20 minutes from any web browser,
					so please don't expect to be paid just for being an expert at something (I'm not discounting
					your value, I'm setting your expectations for being paid for it.)
					<br />&nbsp;
				</li>
				<li>
					Nothing remains hidden, people expect to be able to learn about whatever interests them,
					and they expect whatever they want to know to be well-presented <b>and free.</b>
					<br />
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br />
			Learn this point quickly and well, and you will save a <b>boatload</b> of time and money.  Nobody cares what
			you know, everybody thinks they can learn everything all by themselves.  I'm sorry you
			wasted all that money on schooling, hopefully you can use your education in other ways..

			<h1>All is Not Lost - Return to the Homefront.</h1>
			<p>At a time when the average consumer is bombarded with over of 3,000 advertising messages every day, small
			businesses have trouble competing with the noise, and are often left out in the cold.  ...(not yet finished)...gives you the power
			to filter out national companies or give special attention to advertisements that originate in your hometown.
			You now have the power to <i><b>seek the best value from all businesses</b></i> instead of mindlessly patronizing the companies
			with the biggest advertising budgets.</p>
