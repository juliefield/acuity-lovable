      <h2>Acuity Performance Management System – Quick Start Guide</h2>
      <p>
        Acuity is designed to inform, align, engage and develop agents, mangers
        and other employees.  It’s easy to use and has a range of great features
        to help you succeed! This guide will help you become familiar with the
        system and become proficient in its basic operation.
      </p>

      <hr id="login" />
      <h3>System Login</h3>
      <img src="images/cox_login.png" class="responsive" />
      <p>
        When you login for the first time (simply enter the user name and
        password into the appropriate fields as shown in the screen shot above),
        you will be prompted to change the default password (typically <b>P@ssw0rd</b>)
        to one of your own (remember it or store it somewhere safe for future
        reference should you forget it).
      </p>
      <div class="half-img pull-right" style="margin-left: 15px;">
        <img src="images/pw_change.jpg" class="responsive" />
      </div>
      <p>
        At some point during or near the end of training, you should have
        received a user name and a default password to access Acuity. A special
        url has been set up for you to access Acuity –
      </p>

        <a href="https://bgr.acuityapm.com" target="_blank">https://bgr.acuityapm.com</a>
      </p>
      <div class="clearfix"></div>
      <hr id="dashboard" />
      <h3>Dashboard Basics</h3>
      <p>
        Once logged in to Acuity, a dashboard will display your performance
        scores (actual data values as well as corresponding performance scores
        and levels).
      </p>
      <img src="images/bar_agent.png" class="responsive" />
      <p>
        The number on the top of the gauge in the upper left section of the
        filter panel indicates your current overall aka “balanced score”
        (refreshed at least daily). The gauge is divided into color-coded
        performance levels and scoring resets with the start of each pay period
        or other defined basis.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each KPI for which you are responsible, and that make up the balanced
        score, is displayed so that you can quickly and easily monitor progress
        and pinpoint your strengths and areas that require improvement.
      </p>
      <p>
        The weight (or relative importance) for each KPI is included in the
        label underneath the bar and positioning the cursor over the bar will
        also display KPI details.
      </p>
      <hr id="subkpi" />
      <h3>Sub-KPI Drill-Down</h3>
      <p>
        Double-clicking a specific KPI will either render a tabular view of the
        underlying data or display the sub-KPIs (aka KPI split) that comprise
        the primary KPI (see screen shot below), enabling the specific area of
        weakness to be pinpointed with deep granularity.
      </p>
        <img src="images/sub-kpi_by_agent-1.png" class="responsive" />
      <br />

      <hr id="support" />
      <h3>Communications and Support</h3>
      <br />
      <div class="icon-img">
        <img src="images/chat_icon.jpg" width="50" />
      </div>
      <p>
        If your supervisor has not reached out to you to assist with a weak
        Key Performance Indicator, reach out to them by using the <b>Chat</b>
        feature accessible at the top of Acuity.
      </p>
      <div class="clearfix"></div>
      <br />
      <div class="icon-img">
        <img src="images/messaging_icon.jpg" width="90" style="margin-top:8px;"/>
      </div>
      <p>
        Communication may also be facilitated via Acuity’s conventional
        <b>Messaging</b> feature accessible via the envelope icon. A round marker next
        to the envelope icon will indicate when a new message has been received.
      </p>
      <br />
      <div class="icon-img">
        <img src="images/widget_2.png" width="60"/>
      </div>
      <p>
        The Acuity Notifier is a small “floating” (meaning it can be moved or
        positioned anywhere on the desktop) tool bar that keeps you
        connected when your Acuity dashboard isn’t open on your desktop.
        Notification of New Messages and other information will be displayed
        here and clicking the available buttons will launch the relevant
        module within Acuity.
      </p>

        <br />
        <br />
        The Acuity Notifier is a “tray application” and requires that you
        provide login credentials (same as you use for Acuity) to enable.
      </p>
      <div class="clearfix"></div>


      <hr id="filters"/>
      <h3>Filters and Views</h3>
      <img src="images/filters.png" class="pull-left" width="200" style="margin-right: 15px;"/>
      <p>
        Filters located in Acuity’s left panel - enabled or disabled based on
        role - determine what information is displayed in the main report window.
      </p>
      <p>
        To isolate a specific KPI, use the <b>KPI</b> filter. To view historical
        performance, select a previous date range from the <b>Score View</b> filter.
      </p>
      <p class="tip" style="margin-left: 215px;">
        <strong>TIP:</strong> after selecting filters, click the <b>Plot</b>
        button to run the new or modify the existing report.
      </p>

      <div class="clearfix"></div>
      <hr id="report" />
      <h3>Performance Trend Report</h3>
      <p>
        To view historical trends of overall or KPI-specific score,
        click <b>Trend</b> and set the desired beginning and end dates using the slider.
        <br /><br />
        <img src="images/trend_filter.png" class="responsive"/>
      </p>
      <hr id="views" />
      <h3>Tabular or “Spreadsheet” Views</h3>
      <p>
        Prefer a tabular view of the data? Select the <b>Grid</b> button and click
        <b>Search</b>. Or click on a specific KPI bar in the Bar view to invoke
        a spreadsheet style report.
      </p>
      <img src="images/table_view.png" class="responsive" />

      <hr id="settings" />
      <h3>Report Settings</h3>
      <div class="half-img pull-right">
        <img src="images/settings2.jpg" class="responsive" style="margin-left: 15px;"/>
      </div>
      <p>
        Acuity Settings allow you to change the report display appearance.
        <b>Performance Colors</b> reflect KPI performance as calibrated to
        defined target levels (A/B/C….). The <b>Series Colors</b> options
        apply a distinct color to each KPI bar.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <b>Score Basis</b> setting allows you to view overall score or
        pecific KPI values as either “calibrated” performance scores or Raw
        data values.

            <h2>Sidekick - Digital Ally for the Frontline Superhero </h2>
            <p>
              Sidekick is an intelligent system for coaching, recognition, review,
              and performance management integrated with the Acuity contact center
              performance management platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using Sidekick is Easy…

            <ol>
              <li>

            <hr id="sidekickjournal" />
            <h3>The Sidekick Journal</h3>
            <p>
              The Sidekick Journal provides a place to document all of the interactions,
              such as coaching, recognition, monitors, goal-setting, etc., between team
              leaders (aka supervisors, etc.) and their agents. Adding journaling to your
              regular frontline management routine will ensure that you never have to
              guess with whom or in what ways you’ve lead and developed your team. The
              Journal is your reliable digital system of record.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using the Journal is easy. By default, journal entries are listed in
              table format by Entry Date (most recent on top).  Columns are sortable
              so that this view can be adjusted as desired.

            <h3>Adding a Journal Entry</h3>
            <p>
              As you prepare to initiate a coaching session or other form of support
              interaction with an agent, click the blue <b>Add New Record</b> button located
              in the top right corner of the Journal.

            <h3>Performance Trend </h3>
            <p>
              The Performance Trend displays the day-by-day performance scores by
              Balanced Score or specific KPI for either the Current or Last Month.
              The Performance Trend view also includes all of the journal entries
              recorded that same month. In this way, it’s easy to visualize the impact
              of your agent support activities. Trend lines display performance for
              the focus agent as well as the team average.   Mouse-over the dots on
              the black or blue trend lines will display details about the KPI or
              Balanced Score.  Mouse-over the green dots on the x axis will display
              the summary for the Journal entry. Clicking the green dot will open the
              full Journal entry.

            <h2>Touch Count / Touch Rank</h2>
            <h3>Touch Count</h3>
            <p>
              Touch Count and Touch Rank reports provide context about the frequency
              of your interactions with agents and how this routine correlates with
              performance. Touch Rank looks at three data points:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <b>This CSR:</b> Mouse-over the black bar shows the number of interactions
                (“touches”) with the focus agent in the current month. Mouse-over the
                blue bar shows the average number of touches for the focus agent up
                to the past six months.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Team Average:</b> Mouse-over the black bar shows the average number of
                interactions (“touches”) across all agents on the team. Mouse-over
                the blue bar shows the average number of touches across all agents on
                the focus team for up to the past six months.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>All CSRs:</b> Functions just like Team and This CSR, but across all CSRs
                within the same department, program, or other comparable group.

            <h3>Touch Rank</h3>
            <p>
              Touch Rank displays the number of “touches” and Balanced Score for each
              of the agents on the specified team. The focus agent is highlighted in
              red. The second column shows the number of touches (supervisor/team lead
              support interactions). The third column displays the Balanced Score
              (total performance score reflective of all weighted KPIs). Each column
              can be sorted to customize the view or be adjusted by Current and Last
              Month.

            <p>
              The Trailing Twelve Month trend chart displays the average Touch Count
              per agent over the most recent 12 month period. The black line reflects
              the focus team and the blue line reflects the average across all teams
              performing the same or similar function. The view can be adjusted to
              display the Trailing Twelve Month Performance Score (Balanced Score)
              for the focus (Your) or All Teams using the toggle switch at the top
              right corner of the chart.
