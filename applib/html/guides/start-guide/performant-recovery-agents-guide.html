            <li>Pending Agent Review - these are new CARs that need to be reviewed.</li>
            <li>Pending Agent CAR Confirmation - this is to confirm that you 
              have received Corrective Action from your manager.</li>

          Below is an example of the CAR monitoring form with the status: Pending 
          Agent Review. You can either agree with ALL observations and point

          point on the form.

          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>
              Agree - click on the first radio button labeled "I agree with ALL 
              observations and point totals on this form" and click Submit 
              Acknowledgement / Dispute to Manager button. This releases the 
              form to your manager. Once the form is released to the manager, 
              it can no longer be edited by you. <em>Note: If you click Close, the 
              form will close and remain in Pending Agent Review status.</em> 
            </li>
            <li>
              Disagree - click on the second radio button labeled "I disagree 
              with at least one of the findings, or points assessed above". 
              Check the box below the finding(s) that are being disputed, enter 
              the dispute reason in the Agent Dispute text box. If the box next 
              to the finding is not checked, this means that you agree with that 
              finding or point total. Once the finding(s) are disputed, click 
              Submit Acknowledgement / Dispute to Manager button. This releases 
              the form to your manager. Once the form is released to the manager, 
              it can no longer be edited by you. Note: If you click Close, the 
              form will close and remain in Pending Agent Review status.
              <br>
              <br>
              In the example below the agent is disputing 1 of the 3 findings.

            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          After the Submit Acknowledgement / Dispute to Manager button is clicked, 
          you will navigate back to the IRS or Non-IRS Pending Review report. 
          Click Submit again to re-run the report, this will display CAR's new 
          status:
          <br>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>Pending Corrective Action - if you agreed with ALL observations and point totals.</li>
            <li>Pending Dispute Review - if you disagreed with at least one finding.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          The next step in the process is for your Manager and Compliance to review the CAR. 
          <ul>
            <li>
              If you agreed with the findings, your Manager will perform the Corrective Action. 
            </li>
            <li>
              If you disagreed with any observation, your Manager will review the disputed finding(s). 
              <br>
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If they find the dispute Invalid (in other words, they disagree 
                  with you), they will perform the Corrective Action.
                  <br><br>
                  <div class="centered">
                    <img src="images/recovery-agent5.jpg"  />
                  </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                  If they find the dispute Valid (in other words, they agree with 
                  you), the CAR will be routed to Compliance for dispute review. 
                  Once Compliance completes the dispute review, the CAR will be 
                  returned to the manager for the Corrective Action Step/notification 
                  that the dispute review is complete.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              Once the steps above are complete, the CAR will be returned to you 
              for one last step. The last step in the process is to confirm that 
              you have received Corrective Action Training from your manager.
