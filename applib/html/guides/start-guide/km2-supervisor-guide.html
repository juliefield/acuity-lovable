      <h2>Acuity Performance Management System - Quick Start Guide</h2>
      <p>
        Acuity is designed to inform, align, engage and develop agents, mangers
        and other employees.  It's easy to use and has a range of great features
        to help you succeed! This guide will help you become familiar with the
        system and become proficient in its basic operation.
      </p>

      

      

      <div class="clearfix"></div>
      <hr id="dashboard" />
      <h3>Dashboard Basics</h3>
      <p>
        Once logged in to Acuity, a dashboard will display your performance
        scores (actual data values as well as corresponding performance scores
        and levels).
      </p>
      <img src="images/km2-img1.jpg" class="responsive" />
      <p>
        The number on the top of the gauge in the upper left section of the
        filter panel indicates your current overall aka "balanced score"
        (refreshed at least daily). The gauge is divided into color-coded
        performance levels and scoring resets with the start of each pay period
        or other defined basis.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each KPI for which you are responsible, and that make up the balanced
        score, is displayed so that you can quickly and easily monitor progress
        and pinpoint your strengths and areas that require improvement.
      </p>
      <p>
        The weight (or relative importance) for each KPI is included in the
        label underneath the bar and positioning the cursor over the bar will
        also display KPI details.
      </p>
      <hr id="subkpi" />
      <h3>Sub-KPI Drill-Down</h3>
      <p>
        Double-clicking a specific KPI will either render a tabular view of the
        underlying data or display the sub-KPIs (aka KPI split) that comprise
        the primary KPI (see screen shot below), enabling the specific area of
        weakness to be pinpointed with deep granularity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Communication may also be facilitated via Acuity's conventional
        <b>Messaging</b> feature accessible via the envelope icon. A round marker next
        to the envelope icon will indicate when a new message has been received.
      </p>
      <br />
     
      <h4>Chat</h4>
      <p>
        Acuity has built-in chat functionality for either Live Chat or Group Chat.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Live Chat:</strong> Allows users to chat with others who are logged in to Acuity. 
        Agents can chat with supervisors or other members of management that are 
        logged in and online. They can not chat with other agents.

      <p>
        <strong>Group Chat:</strong> Supervisors and management can create group 
        chats. Chat recipients do not need to be online chat. New messages will 
        appear upon log-in. Agents cannot create a group chat but they can 
        participate in the group chats.

        Filters located in Acuity's left panel - enabled or disabled based on
        role - determine what information is displayed in the main report window.
      </p>
      <p>
        To isolate a specific KPI, use the <b>KPI</b> filter. To view historical
        performance, select a previous date range from the <b>Score View</b> filter.

          Complete the fields on the form. 
          <p>
            <strong>Rating / notes - </strong>there are 6 rating options. When the audit is first created, 
            the rating should be Pass or Fail (see the Compliance Workflow diagram at the 
            beginning of this section). Some of these Ratings will automatically complete 
            the audit.

          Note: Drafts are only visible to Compliance and Admin.

          Save Audit: this saves the Audit.

        is Supervisor Coaching. The assigned supervisor at the time the audit

        agent. The Supervisor will document the coaching in the Compliance Audit 
        form and will complete the following steps:

      <ol>
        <li>
          Click on the Reports tab.

        <li>
          A text field is provided to document the coaching.

      <h4>Automated Acuity Process to document the Coaching Interaction:</h4>
      <p>
        When Supervisor Coaching is complete in the Compliance Audit, an Auto-generated 
        Journal Entry will be created in Sidekick to document the coaching interaction. 
        The Journal Entry category for Auto-generated Journal Entry from the Compliance 
        Audit will be designated as "Coaching-Compliance Audit". The agents do not 
        receive a separate message notification regarding the Journal Entry since 
        they will see the coaching comments when they confirm the coaching interaction 
        in the Compliance Audit. 
      </p>
      <p>

      <h3>Supervisor Coaching</h3>
      <p>
        After the Scorecard reviewed and approved by the Supervisor or the Dispute
        has been reviewed by QA, the next step in the workflow is Supervisor
        Coaching. The assigned supervisor at the time the Scorecard was created
        will be responsible to review the Scorecard and coach the agent. Once
        coaching on the Scorecard has occurred, the Supervisor will document it
        and will complete the following steps:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Click on the Reports tab.
        </li>
        <li>
          Select the Pending QA Scorecards.
        </li>
        <li>
          Open the Filter panel to change and of the search parameters such as
          data range (Score View). <em>Tip: there may be pending scorecards from

          Score View to view all pending scorecards.</em>
        </li>

      <h4>Automated Acuity Process to document the Coaching Interaction:</h4>
      <p>
        When Supervisor Coaching is complete in the QA Scorecard, an Auto-generated 
        Journal Entry will be created in Sidekick to document the coaching interaction. 
        The Journal Entry category for Auto-generated Journal Entry from the Compliance 
        Audit will be designated as "Coaching-QA Scorecard". The agents do not receive 
        a separate message notification regarding the Journal Entry since they will see 
        the coaching comments when they confirm the coaching interaction in the QA 
        Scorecard. 
      </p>
      <p>
