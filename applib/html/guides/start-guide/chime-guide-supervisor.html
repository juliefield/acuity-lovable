      <h2>Acuity Performance Management System - Quick Start Guide</h2>
      <p>
        Acuity is designed to inform, align, engage and develop agents, mangers
        and other employees.  It's easy to use and has a range of great features
        to help you succeed! This guide will help you become familiar with the
        system and become proficient in its basic operation.
      </p>

      <hr id="login" />
      <h3>System Login</h3>
      <img src="images/cox_login.png" class="responsive" />
      <p>
        When you login for the first time (simply enter the user name and
        password into the appropriate fields as shown in the screen shot above),
        you will be prompted to change the default password (typically <b>P@ssw0rd</b>)
        to one of your own (remember it or store it somewhere safe for future
        reference should you forget it).
      </p>
      <div class="half-img pull-right" style="margin-left: 15px;">
        <img src="images/pw_change.jpg" class="responsive" />
      </div>
      <p>
        At some point during or near the end of training, you should have
        received a user name and a default password to access Acuity. A special
        url has been set up for you to access Acuity -
      </p>
      <p>
        <a id="id_link" href="https://<your prefix>.acuityapm.com" target="_blank">https://acuityapm.com</a>
      </p>

      <div class="clearfix"></div>
      <hr id="lookup" />
      <h3>Look-up Acuity Username (Acuity User ID)</h3>
      <p>
        Supervisors have access to a report that displays all Acuity User Information. 
        All active Chime employees are assigned an Acuity Username (Acuity User ID) and 
        have access to Acuity. Below are the instructions on how to find an Acuity 
        Username and the initial temporary password.
      </p>
      <p>
        1. After logging into Acuity, click on the Reports Menu
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Select the User Report under the User Access Report section.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Click Search
      </p>
      <img src="images/chime-updateimg-1.jpg" class="responsive" />
      <p>
        4. When the following report appears. The report can be searched by typing the Search box. 
      </p>
      <p>Please note: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The search field is case-sensitive and must be spelled exactly how it appears in the database.</li>
        <li>The arrows will sort the report. Click once for ascending to descending and click again for descending to ascending.</li>
      </ul>
      <img src="images/chime-updateimg-2.jpg" class="responsive" />
      <p>Below are the search results. The Acuity ID will be displayed.</p>
      <img src="images/chime-updateimg-3.jpg" class="responsive" />
      <p>
        If you don't find what you're looking for, try different spelling or search 
        on a different field such as First name or Associate ID. In the example below 
        "Chandler" does not return any search results because the last name has a 
        lower-case "c". By typing in the first few letters of the first name 
        "Krist", the record is displayed.
      </p>
      <img src="images/chime-updateimg-4.jpg" class="responsive" />


      <div class="clearfix"></div>
      <hr id="temp-password" />
      <h3>Temporary Password - Initial Acuity Log-in</h3>
      <p>
        The first time the user accesses Acuity they need to use their Acuity Username 
        (Acuity ID) and the temporary password below:
      </p>
      <p><b>Temporary password:</b> P@ssw0rd </p>
      <p>NOTE:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>This is case sensitive and make sure to use a "zero" and not an "o"</li>
        <li>Upon log-in, they will be prompted to change the password.</li>
      </ul>


      <div class="clearfix"></div>
      <hr id="dashboard" />
      <h3>Dashboard Basics</h3>
      <p>
        Once logged in to Acuity, a dashboard will display your performance
        scores (actual data values as well as corresponding performance scores
        and levels).
      </p>
      <img src="images/bar_agent-chime.png" class="responsive" />
      <p>
        The number on the top of the gauge in the upper left section of the
        filter panel indicates your current overall aka "balanced score"
        (refreshed at least daily). The gauge is divided into color-coded
        performance levels and scoring resets with the start of each pay period
        or other defined basis.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each KPI for which you are responsible, and that make up the balanced
        score, is displayed so that you can quickly and easily monitor progress
        and pinpoint your strengths and areas that require improvement.
      </p>
      <p>
        The weight (or relative importance) for each KPI is included in the
        label underneath the bar and positioning the cursor over the bar will
        also display KPI details.
      </p>
      <hr id="subkpi" />
      <h3>Sub-KPI Drill-Down</h3>
      <p>
        Double-clicking a specific KPI will either render a tabular view of the
        underlying data or display the sub-KPIs (aka KPI split) that comprise
        the primary KPI (see screen shot below), enabling the specific area of
        weakness to be pinpointed with deep granularity.
      </p>
        <img src="images/sub-kpi_by_agent-1-chime.jpg" class="responsive" />
      <br />

      <hr id="support" />
      <h3>Communications and Support</h3>
      <br />
      <div class="icon-img">
        <img src="images/chat_icon.jpg" width="50" />
      </div>
      <p>
        If your supervisor has not reached out to you to assist with a weak
        Key Performance Indicator, reach out to them by using the <b>Chat</b>
        feature accessible at the top of Acuity.
      </p>
      <div class="clearfix"></div>
      <br />
      <div class="icon-img">
        <img src="images/messaging_icon.jpg" width="90" style="margin-top:8px;"/>
      </div>
      <p>
        Communication may also be facilitated via Acuity's conventional
        <b>Messaging</b> feature accessible via the envelope icon. A round marker next
        to the envelope icon will indicate when a new message has been received.
      </p>
      <br />
      <div class="icon-img">
        <img src="images/widget_2.png" width="60"/>
      </div>
      <p>
        The Acuity Notifier is a small "floating" (meaning it can be moved or
        positioned anywhere on the desktop) tool bar that keeps you
        connected when your Acuity dashboard isn't open on your desktop.
        Notification of New Messages and other information will be displayed
        here and clicking the available buttons will launch the relevant
        module within Acuity.

        <br />
        <br />
        The Acuity Notifier is a "tray application" and requires that you
        provide login credentials (same as you use for Acuity) to enable.

      <h3>Filters and Views</h3>
      <img src="images/filters-chime.png" class="pull-left" width="200" style="margin-right: 15px;"/>
      <p>
        Filters located in Acuity's left panel - enabled or disabled based on
        role - determine what information is displayed in the main report window.
      </p>
      <p>

      </div>
      <p>
        Acuity Settings allow you to change the report display appearance.
        <b>Performance Colors</b> reflect KPI performance as calibrated to
        defined target levels (A/B/C...). The <b>Series Colors</b> options
        apply a distinct color to each KPI bar.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <b>Score Basis</b> setting allows you to view overall score or
        pecific KPI values as either "calibrated" performance scores or Raw
        data values.

            <h3>The Sidekick Journal</h3>
            <p>
              The Sidekick Journal provides a place to document all of the interactions,
              such as coaching, recognition, monitors, goal-setting, etc., between team
              leaders (aka supervisors, etc.) and their agents. Adding journaling to your
              regular frontline management routine will ensure that you never have to
              guess with whom or in what ways you've lead and developed your team. The
              Journal is your reliable digital system of record.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using the Journal is easy. By default, journal entries are listed in
              table format by Entry Date (most recent on top).  Columns are sortable
              so that this view can be adjusted as desired.

              Touch Count and Touch Rank reports provide context about the frequency
              of your interactions with agents and how this routine correlates with
              performance. Touch Rank looks at three data points:

              <li>
                <b>Team Average:</b> Mouse-over the black bar shows the average number of

              The new Sidekick Touch Quality feature provides supervisors with
              real-time insight into the support quality delivered to their agents.
              Touch Quality allows employees to anonymously rate each one of their
              interactions with their supervisor on a scale from 1 to 5. The
              addition of Touch Quality to the Sidekick support system produces
              a continuous measure of employee satisfaction and ensures the
              integrity of support delivery.

                Touch Quality is a process that takes place after a Sidekick

                agents

              <li>
                Once a journal entry has been submitted for an agent, an
                automatic notification is sent to the agent to acknowledge and
                anonymously rate that interaction with their supervisor
