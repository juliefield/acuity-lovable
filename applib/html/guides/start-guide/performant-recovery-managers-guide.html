        Example: Team Managers can view all CSRs on their teams. CSRs can only 
        see their own data. To view historical performance, select a previous 
        date range from the <b>Score View</b> filter.

              <strong>Dispute is Valid -</strong> in other words, you agree with the agent and

              enter comments and then click Submit Response to Compliance /

              <strong>Dispute is Invalid -</strong> in other words, disagree with the agent and

              enter comments and then click Submit Response to Compliance / 
              Complete Dispute Review. This will change the status to Pending 
              Corrective Action (provided that no other findings on the CAR are

            </li>
            <li>
              Pending Compliance Review - you found at least one of the disputed 
              findings to be valid and therefore the dispute will be reviewed by 
              Compliance. Once Compliance has completed the review, the next status 
              will be Pending Corrective Action.
              <br>
              <br>
              Once Compliance completes their review, the CAR will be returned to 
              perform the Corrective Action. <em>Note: this step will still take place 
              even if the finding was removed as this will serve as your notification

            <h3>The Sidekick Journal</h3>
            <p>
              The Sidekick Journal provides a place to document all of the interactions,
              such as coaching, recognition, monitors, goal-setting, etc., between team
              leaders (aka supervisors, etc.) and their agents. Adding journaling to your
              regular frontline management routine will ensure that you never have to
              guess with whom or in what ways you've lead and developed your team. The
              Journal is your reliable digital system of record.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using the Journal is easy. By default, journal entries are listed in
              table format by Entry Date (most recent on top).  Columns are sortable
              so that this view can be adjusted as desired.

            <h3>Performance Trend </h3>
            <p>
              The Performance Trend displays the day-by-day performance scores by
              Balanced Score or specific KPI for either the Current or Last Month.
              The Performance Trend view also includes all of the journal entries
              recorded that same month. In this way, it's easy to visualize the impact
              of your agent support activities. Trend lines display performance for
              the focus agent as well as the team average.   Mouse-over the dots on
              the black or blue trend lines will display details about the KPI or
              Balanced Score.  Mouse-over the green dots on the x axis will display
              the summary for the Journal entry. Clicking the green dot will open the
              full Journal entry.

            <h3>Touch Count</h3>
            <p>
              Touch Count and Touch Rank reports provide context about the frequency
              of your interactions with agents and how this routine correlates with
              performance. Touch Rank looks at three data points:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <b>This CSR:</b> Mouse-over the black bar shows the number of interactions
                ("touches") with the focus agent in the current month. Mouse-over the
                blue bar shows the average number of touches for the focus agent up
                to the past six months.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Team Average:</b> Mouse-over the black bar shows the average number of
                interactions ("touches") across all agents on the team. Mouse-over
                the blue bar shows the average number of touches across all agents on
                the focus team for up to the past six months.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>All CSRs:</b> Functions just like Team and This CSR, but across all CSRs

            <h3>Touch Rank</h3>
            <p>
              Touch Rank displays the number of "touches" and Balanced Score for each
              of the agents on the specified team. The focus agent is highlighted in
              red. The second column shows the number of touches (supervisor/team lead
              support interactions). The third column displays the Balanced Score
              (total performance score reflective of all weighted KPIs). Each column
              can be sorted to customize the view or be adjusted by Current and Last
              Month.

              The Trailing Twelve Month trend chart displays the average Touch Count
              per agent over the most recent 12 month period. The black line reflects
              the focus team and the blue line reflects the average across all teams
              performing the same or similar function. The view can be adjusted to
              display the Trailing Twelve Month Performance Score (Balanced Score)
              for the focus (Your) or All Teams using the toggle switch at the top

            <h3>Sidekick Touch Quality</h3>
            <p>
              The new Sidekick Touch Quality feature provides supervisors with 
              real-time insight into the support quality delivered to their agents. 
              Touch Quality allows employees to anonymously rate each one of their 
              interactions with their supervisor on a scale from 1 to 5. The 
              addition of Touch Quality to the Sidekick support system produces a 
              continuous measure of employee satisfaction and ensures the integrity 
              of support delivery.
            </p>
            <h4>Touch Quality Workflow</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Touch Quality is a process that takes place after a Sidekick 
                Journal entry has been completed by a supervisor for one of their agents
                <br><br>
                <div class="centered">

              </li>
              <li>
                Once a journal entry has been submitted for an agent, an automatic 
                notification is sent to the agent to acknowledge and anonymously 
                rate that interaction with their supervisor
                <br><br>
                <ul style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                  <li>
                    The automatic notification will be received via the message 
                    center inside of Acuity, which can be accessed by clicking the 
                    Envelope Icon or clicking "Message Center" and opening the

                  <li>
                    The notification message will include the following information (also pictured below):

              </li>
              <li>
                To rate the interaction, agents will simply click the blue link that 
                reads, "Please Acknowledge and Rate Your Recent Support Experience" 
                which will open a window that allows the employee to select between
