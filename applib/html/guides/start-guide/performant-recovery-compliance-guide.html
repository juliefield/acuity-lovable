      <p>
        Filters located in Acuity's left panel - enabled or disabled based on 
        role - determine what information is displayed in the main report window. 
        The filter is expandable and collapsible.
      </p>
      <p>
        To isolate specific data (location, DM, TM, CSR, or date range) use theÂ 
        filter. The data selection in the Filter panel is based on hierarchy. 
        Example: Team Managers can view all CSRs on their teams. CSRs can only 
        see their own data. To view historical performance, select a previous 
        date range from the <b>Score View</b> filter.
      </p>
      <p class="tip">
        <strong>TIP:</strong> after selecting filters, click the <b>Submit</b>
        button to run the new or modify the existing report.

            <h3>The Sidekick Journal</h3>
            <p>
              The Sidekick Journal provides a place to document all of the interactions,
              such as coaching, recognition, monitors, goal-setting, etc., between team
              leaders (aka supervisors, etc.) and their agents. Adding journaling to your
              regular frontline management routine will ensure that you never have to
              guess with whom or in what ways you've lead and developed your team. The
              Journal is your reliable digital system of record.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using the Journal is easy. By default, journal entries are listed in
              table format by Entry Date (most recent on top).  Columns are sortable
              so that this view can be adjusted as desired.

              Touch Count and Touch Rank reports provide context about the frequency
              of your interactions with agents and how this routine correlates with
              performance. Touch Rank looks at three data points:

                <b>This CSR:</b> Mouse-over the black bar shows the number of interactions

                to the past six months.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Team Average:</b> Mouse-over the black bar shows the average number of

            <h3>Touch Rank</h3>

              Touch Rank displays the number of "touches" and Balanced Score for each

              support interactions). The third column displays the Balanced Score
              (total performance score reflective of all weighted KPIs). Each column

              the focus team and the blue line reflects the average across all teams

            <h3>Sidekick Touch Quality</h3>
            <p>
              The new Sidekick Touch Quality feature provides supervisors with 
              real-time insight into the support quality delivered to their agents. 
              Touch Quality allows employees to anonymously rate each one of their 
              interactions with their supervisor on a scale from 1 to 5. The 
              addition of Touch Quality to the Sidekick support system produces a 
              continuous measure of employee satisfaction and ensures the integrity 
              of support delivery.
            </p>
            <h4>Touch Quality Workflow</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Touch Quality is a process that takes place after a Sidekick 
                Journal entry has been completed by a supervisor for one of their agents
                <br><br>
                <div class="centered">
                  <img src="images/recovery-touch1.jpg"   />
                </div><br>
                
              </li>
              <li>
                Once a journal entry has been submitted for an agent, an automatic 
                notification is sent to the agent to acknowledge and anonymously 
                rate that interaction with their supervisor
                <br><br>
                <ul style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                  <li>
                    The automatic notification will be received via the message 
                    center inside of Acuity, which can be accessed by clicking the 
                    Envelope Icon or clicking "Message Center" and opening the 
                    notification message
                    <br><br>
                    <div class="centered">
                      <img src="images/recovery-touch2.png"  />
                    </div>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The notification message will include the following information (also pictured below):
                    <ul style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                      <li>
                        Date the journal entry was submitted
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Reason for the entry (example: Coaching or Recognition)
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Details or Issues that were discussed (areas of opportunity)
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Resolution or Follow Up notes (action plan)
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Any goals that were set (Note: if no goals were set, no data will appear)
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Link to rate the recent support experience
                        <br><br>
                        <div class="centered">
                          <img src="images/recovery-touch3.jpg" class="responsive"  />
                        </div>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                To rate the interaction, agents will simply click the blue link that 
                reads, "Please Acknowledge and Rate Your Recent Support Experience" 
                which will open a window that allows the employee to select between 
                one and five stars to rate the interaction
                <br><br>

                <ul style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                  <li>
                    NOTE: ALL RATINGS ARE ANONYMOUS TO SUPERVISORS
                    <br><br>
                        <div class="centered">
                          <img src="images/recovery-touch4.jpg"   />
                        </div>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Once ratings are submitted, supervisors and managers will be 
                able to track their Touch Quality scores through the Sidekick 
                page, using the Touch Quality chart
                <br><br>
                <div class="centered">
                  <img src="images/recovery-touch5.jpg"   />
                </div>

                <ul style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                  <li>
                    The "My Team" score is the average score of all ratings 
                    received for the selected supervisor's team during the chosen 
                    date range

                    <ul style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                      <li>
                        There are currently two date range options: Current Month and Previous Month
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    The "All Team" score is the average score of all ratings 
                    received for all teams assigned to the selected Project
                    <ul style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                      <li>
                        This provides supervisors and managers with the ability 
                        to compare employee satisfaction against multiple teams, 
                        and the average for all teams
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Additional information is provided along the bottom of the 
                    graph, which includes the number of entries (journal entries 
                    submitted), number of ratings (how many of the entries have 
                    been acknowledged and rated), and the ratio (Ratings / Number 
                    of Entries)
                  </li>
