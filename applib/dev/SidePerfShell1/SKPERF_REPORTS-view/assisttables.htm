<!--

//Telling child that we need to do sidekick-specific drilling on an agent and broadcast 'scheduleOnOnOne'
//when clicked by adding a panel="sk_assist_table" att

ribute - Kind of vague, maybe there's better naming.

//Tell child that we need a record count from the table whenever it's changed.
//Create function in parent, send it's name to child as an attribute?
//  f_recordcount="displayRecordCount"   ?

//Tell child to listen for a change in a select box to refresh the table
//  control_ReportCidSelector="#myselectionbox"

//Tell a child to consider a checkbox, such as "In Training" or "Raw vs Balanced"
//  control_InTrainingSelector="#myintrainingcheckbox"

//What if I manage each chart from it's own controller - or at least in the case where multiple co-directives
are needed, do this?  In this case, the "broadcast" could be limited to the scope of the controller (I think).
The presence of your own controller would ideally be optional (thus detectable).
//Can a controller be specified to a directive by attributes?  It would be nice to de-couple the display from the item.
